<p>Our product, CHiLO, which stands for Creative Higher Education with Learning Object, is based on e-textbooks. CHiLO consists of four components as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li> CHiLO Book,  </li>
<li> CHiLO Lectures,  </li>
<li> CHiLO Badges, and  </li>
<li> CHiLO Communities. </li>
</ol>


<p> The CHiLO Book is core component which packages learning contents and all sorts of technological components. The CHiLO Lectures consist of a series of 1-minute nano-lecture video clips. The CHiLO Badges are based on digital badges such as those used in SNSs and Gamification. The CHiLO Communities are learning communities combining open SNSs such as Facebook, Twitter and LMS forums. </p>

<p> The CHiLO Book is provided the EPUB3 format. This is device independent and convenient for learners who want to study offline. However, the main challenge with the EPUB3 format is that most e-book readers do not currently support media-rich functions, such as embedded videos, JavaScript and JSON. To solve this problem, the CHiLO Book is also provided HTML5 format. This is very convenient for learners who have constant access to the Internet. </p>
