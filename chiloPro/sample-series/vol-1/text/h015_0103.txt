<p> We focused on a potential value of e-book for online education to overcome Digital Divide in developing countries. E-books inherit some good points seen in traditional books, such as flipping pages, the visibility of per-page design and its convenience. Many e-book reader apps are available for many devices like smart phones, tablet devices and also PCs. Not necessary to always be on the internet except while downloading the e-books. E-books can perfectly compile all the learning resources.  </p>
